# CEIntel: AI engine of [CollabEd](https://github.com/wageeshar/collabed.git)

CEIntel uses the power of deep learning and natural language processing to process, learn, memorise
and generate content using latest technologies:
* networks (e.g., transformers, LSTM, RNN, MLP)
* text embedding and encoding tools (e.g., BERT, Word2Vec)

Note: currently implementations are done only for a document classification algorithm with BERT encoder. Other algorithms are being designed for the moment.
